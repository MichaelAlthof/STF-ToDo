Name of QuantLet: STF2tvch04

Published in: Statistical Tools for Finance and Insurance

Description: 'Plots the estimation output of the tvARCH(1) model for SP500 data including the predicted volatilities and forecasting errors relative to GARCH; the numerical values of mean absolute errors are also provided. For faster, but less precise computation, the bandwidth can be set to a fixed value at the end of the for loop.'

Keywords: 'arch, garch, returns, time-series, nonstationary, heteroskedasticity, forecast, volatility'
