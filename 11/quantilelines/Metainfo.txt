Input: 'step: scalar, time interval between points at which the quantiles are computed
        data: n x m x 2 array, data, where n is the length of trajectories and m the number of trajectories
        perc: s x 1 vector, orders of quantiles'

Output: 'y: p x q matrix, where first column contains time and the remaining quantiles'

Example: 'y = quantilelines(data,step,perc)
          RandStream.setGlobalStream(RandStream("mt19937ar","seed",99));
          y = simHPP(2,20,100);
          q = quantilelines(y,1,[0.1,0.5,0.9]);
          plot(q(:,1),q(:,2),"k-")
          hold on
          plot(q(:,1),q(:,3),"k-")
          plot(q(:,1),q(:,4),"k-")
          plot(y(:,1,1),y(:,1,2),"r-")'
