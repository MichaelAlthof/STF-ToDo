Name of QuantLet: simNHPPRP

Published in: Statistical Tools for Finance and Insurance

Description: 'Simulated trajectories of the risk process. [t,y]=SIMNHPPRP(u,theta,lambda,parlambda,distrib,params,T,N) returns N simulated trajectories of the risk process with claim sizes from the distribution specified in DISTRIB with parameters in PARAMS. The claim arrival process corresponds to the non-homogeneous Poisson process with inensity specified by LAMBDA (0 - sine function, 1 - linear function, 3 - sine square function) with parameters in PARLAMBDA. THETA is the relative safety loading, U the initial capital and T the time horizon. A function reuqired by STFloss10.'

Keywords: simulation, risk, risk process, Poisson process, poisson, distribution
